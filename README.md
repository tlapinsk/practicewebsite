# Second Sample Website

This is a second sample website that I'm creating as an exercise that is part of [*Learn Enoughâ„¢ Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), one of the best Git tutorials that I've found on the web.

It also includes quite a few other tutorials, that can be found [here](http://learnenough.com/)

Be sure to checkout the [email list](http://learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @learnenough](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

This has possibly been one of the best resources for learning Git. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out the rest of the tracks once they're built out (especially the Ruby, Sinatra, etc.).
